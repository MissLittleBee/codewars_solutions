Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is `to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others`. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in **evenness**. Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

`!` Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a `real IQ test`, which means indexes of the elements start from `1 (not 0)`

## Examples:

```csharp
IQ.Test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

IQ.Test("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
```
```javascript
iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
```
```typescript
iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
```
```ruby
iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 # Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 # Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
```
```python
iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 # Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 # Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
```
```rust
iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
```
